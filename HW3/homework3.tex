% FDV: Last year, we pointed folks to
% https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Papers/bayesGauss.pdf
% and folks ended up basically copying from it and not doing any derivation
% For this year, I modified to ask folks to do the full derivation in
% 1.1 but then give them the formula for the marginal likelihood so
% they don't have to derive that.  Open to other variations:
% basically, I think it's probably okay for one part to have a longer
% derivation, but if folks think it's too much, we could have students
% refer to the paper above again or just give them the formula for 1.1
% and ask them to simply interpret it.

\begin{problem}[Bayesian Methods]

  This question helps to build your understanding of making
  predictions with a maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), a maximum a
  posterior estimator (MAP), and a full posterior predictive.

  Consider a one-dimensional random variable $x \sim \mu + \epsilon$,
  where it is known that $\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$.  Suppose we
  have a prior $\mu \sim N(0,\tau^2)$ on the mean. You observe iid data $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ (denote the data as $D$).


\textbf{We derive the distribution of $x|D$ for you.}

\textbf{The full posterior predictive is computed using:}

$$p(x|D)=\int p(x, \mu|D) d\mu =\int p(x|\mu)p(\mu|D) d\mu $$


\textbf{One can show that, in this case, the full posterior predictive distribution has a nice analytic
  form:}
   \begin{align}
        x|D \sim \mathcal{N}\Bigg(\frac{\sum_{x_i\in D}x_i}{n+\frac{\sigma^2}{\tau^2}}, (\frac{n}{\sigma^2}+\frac{1}{\tau^2})^{-1} + \sigma^2\Bigg)
     \end{align}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Derive the distribution of $\mu|D$.

  \item 
  In many problems, it is often difficult to
  calculate the full posterior because we need to marginalize out the parameters as above (here,
  the parameter is $\mu$). We can mitigate this problem by plugging in
  a point estimate of $\mu^*$ rather than a distribution.

  a) Derive the MLE
  estimate $\mu_{MLE}$.
  % using $p(D|\mu)$.
  
  b) Derive the MAP estimate $\mu_{MAP}$. % using $p(\mu|D)$

  c) What is the relation between $\mu_{MAP}$ and the mean of $x|D$?

  d) For a fixed value of $\mu=\mu^*$, what is the distribution of $x|\mu^*$? Thus, what is the distribution of $x|\mu_{MLE}$ and $x|\mu_{MAP}$?

  e) Is the variance of $x|D$ greater or smaller than the variance of $x|\mu_{MLE}$? What is the limit of the variance of $x|D$ as $n$ tends to infinity? Explain why this is intuitive.


\item Let us compare $\mu_{MLE}$  and $\mu_{MAP}$. There are three cases to consider:

 a) Assume $\sum_{x_i \in D} x_i=0$. What are the values of $\mu_{MLE}$ and $\mu_{MAP}$?

 b) Assume $\sum_{x_i \in D} x_i>0$. Is $\mu_{MLE}$ greater than $\mu_{MAP}$?

 c) Assume $\sum_{x_i \in D} x_i<0$. Is $\mu_{MLE}$ greater than $\mu_{MAP}$?
  
    
\item Compute:

$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mu_{MAP}}{\mu_{MLE}}$$

  \end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}[Bayesian Frequentist Reconciliation]
    In this question, we connect the Bayesian version of regression with the frequentist view we have seen in the first week of class by showing how appropriate priors could correspond to regularization penalities in the frequentist world, and how the models can be different.
    
    Suppose we have a $D$-dimensional labelled dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{(y_i, \mathbf{x}_i)\}_{i=1}^N$. We can assume that $y_i$ is generated by the following random process: $$y_i = \mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x}_i + \epsilon_i$$ where all $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ are IID. Using matrix notation, we denote
    \begin{align*}
      \mathbf{X} &= \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{x}_1 & \ldots & \mathbf{x}_N\end{bmatrix}^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times D} \\
      \mathbf{y} &= \begin{bmatrix} y_1 & \dots & y_n \end{bmatrix}^\top  \in \mathbb{R}^N \\
      \mathbf{\epsilon} &= \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_1 & \dots & \epsilon_N \end{bmatrix}^\top \in \mathbb{R}^N.
    \end{align*}
    
    Then we can write have $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{w} + \mathbf{\epsilon}$. Now, we will suppose that $\mathbf{w}$ is random as well as our labels! We choose to impose the Laplacian prior $p(\mathbf{w})=\frac{1}{2\tau}\exp\left(-\frac{\|\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{\mu}\|_1}{\tau}\right)$, where $\|\mathbf{w}\|_1=\sum_{i=1}^P |w_i|$ denotes the $L^1$ norm of $\mathbf{w}$, $\mathbf{\mu}$ the location parameter, and $\tau$ is the scale factor.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
    
        \item Compute the posterior distribution $p(\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y})$ of $\mathbf{w}$ given the observed data $\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y}$, up to a normalizing constant. You \textbf{do not} need to simplify the posterior to match a known distribution.
        
        \item Determine the MAP estimate $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{MAP}}$ of $\mathbf{w}$. You may leave the answer as the solution to an equation. How does this relate to regularization in the frequentist perspective? How does the scale factor $\tau$ relate to the corresponding regularization parameter $\lambda$? Provide intuition on the connection to regularization, using the prior imposed on $\mathbf{w}$.
        
        \item Based on the previous question, how might we incorporate prior expert knowledge we may have for the problem? For instance, suppose we knew beforehand that $\mathbf{w}$ should be close to some vector $\mathbf{v}$ in value. How might we incorporate this in the model, and explain why this makes sense in both the Bayesian and frequentist viewpoints.
        
        \item As $\tau$ decreases, what happens to the entries of the estimate $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{MAP}}$? What happens in the limit as $\tau \to 0$?
        
        \item Consider the providing the point estimate $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{mean}}$ is based on the mean of the posterior $\mathbf{w}|\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y}$. Provide an expression for the estimate $\mathbf{w}_{\mathrm{mean}}$, up to a normalizing constant. Based on this expression, which model (original or Bayesian) would we expect to take longer to train? Further, \textbf{if} the model assumptions are correct (i.e. there indeed is a linear relationship and $\mathbf{w}$ is indeed sample from a Laplace distribution), which model would we expect to have a lower test MSE?
        
    \end{enumerate}

% FDV: We had a lot of debate about this problem, whether it's useful
% for students to have to derive this by hand or not... if we want
% alternatives, ideas could include
%% (1) demonstrate the fact that there are good solutions near any
% starting point (run restarts from many starts, see that the answers
% have good quality but very different weights)
% (2) do a double-descent with linear regression (using very small N).

\begin{problem}[Neural Net Optimization]

  In this problem, we will take a closer look at how gradients are calculated for backprop with a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP will consist of a first fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation, followed by a one-dimensional, second fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation to get a prediction for a binary classification problem. Assume bias has not been merged. Let:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item $\bold{W}_1$ be the weights of the first layer, $\bold{b}_1$ be the bias of the first layer.
      \item $\bold{W}_2$ be the weights of the second layer, $\bold{b}_2$ be the bias of the second layer.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The described architecture can be written mathematically as: $$\hat{y} = \sigma(\bold{W}_2 \left[\sigma \left(\bold{W}_1 \bold{x} + \bold{b}_1\right)\right] + \bold{b}_2)$$
  
  where $\hat{y}$ is a scalar output of the net when passing in the single datapoint $\bold{x}$ (represented as a column vector), the additions are element-wise additions, and the sigmoid is an element-wise sigmoid.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Let:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item $N$ be the number of datapoints we have
          \item $M$ be the dimensionality of the data
          \item $H$ be the size of the hidden dimension of the first layer. Here, hidden dimension is used to describe the dimension of the resulting value after going through the layer. Based on the problem description, the hidden dimension of the second layer is 1.
      \end{itemize}
      
      Write out the dimensionality of each of the parameters, and of the intermediate variables:

          \begin{align*}
          \bold{a}_1 &= \bold{W}_1 \bold{x} + \bold{b}_1, 
          &\bold{z}_1 = \sigma(\bold{a}_1) \\
          a_2 &= \bold{W}_2 \bold{z}_1 + \bold{b}_2, 
          &\hat{y} = z_2 = \sigma(a_2)
          \end{align*}
          
      and make sure they work with the mathematical operations described above.
      
    \item  We will derive the gradients for each of the parameters.  The gradients can be used in gradient descent to find weights that improve our model's performance. For this question, assume there is only one datapoint $\bold{x}$, and that our loss is $L = -(y \log (\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log (1 - \hat{y}))$. For all questions, the chain rule will be useful.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_2}$. 
        
        \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_2^h}$, where $W_2^h$ represents the $h$th element of $\bold{W}_2$.
        
        \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_1^h}$, where $b_1^h$ represents the $h$th element of $\bold{b}_1$. (*Hint: Note that only the $h$th element of $\bold{a}_1$ and $\bold{z}_1$ depend on $b_1^h$ - this should help you with how to use the chain rule.)
        
        \item Find $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_1^{h,m}}$, where  $W_1^{h,m}$ represents the element in row $h$, column $m$ in $\bold{W}_1$.
    
    \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
