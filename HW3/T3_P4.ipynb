Unlike in NumPy, PyTorch allows you to perform tensor operations on the GPU. This, alongside dynamic auto-differentiation, makes PyTorch extremely performative and flexible. Learning to use PyTorch will mean you are able to prototype, train, and test production-quality models for work or research.\n",
